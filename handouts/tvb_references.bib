  abstract = {Neurocomputational models of large-scale brain dynamics utilizing
	realistic connectivity matrices have advanced our understanding of
	the operational network principles in the brain. In particular, spontaneous
	or resting state activity has been studied on various scales of spatial
	and temporal organization including those that relate to physiological,
	encephalographic and hemodynamic data. In this article we focus on
	the brain from the perspective of a dynamic network and discuss the
	role of its network constituents in shaping brain dynamics. These
	constituents include the brain's structural connectivity, the population
	dynamics of its network nodes and the time delays involved in signal
	transmission. In addition, no discussion of brain dynamics would
	be complete without considering noise and stochastic effects. In
	fact, there is mounting evidence that the interaction between noise
	and dynamics plays an important functional role in shaping key brain
	processes. In particular, we discuss a unifying theoretical framework
	that explains how structured spatio-temporal resting state patterns
	emerge from noise driven explorations of unstable or stable oscillatory
	states. Embracing this perspective, we explore the consequences of
	network manipulations to understand some of the brain's dysfunctions,
	as well as network effects that offer new insights into routes towards
	therapy, recovery and brain repair. These collective insights will
	be at the core of a new computational environment, the Virtual Brain,
	which will allow flexible incorporation of empirical data constraining
	the brain models to integrate, unify and predict network responses
	to incipient pathological processes.},

  abstract = {Functionally relevant large scale brain dynamics operates within the
	framework imposed by anatomical connectivity and time delays due
	to finite transmission speeds. To gain insight on the reliability
	and comparability of large scale brain network simulations, we investigate
	the effects of variations in the anatomical connectivity. Two different
	sets of detailed global connectivity structures are explored, the
	first extracted from the CoCoMac database and rescaled to the spatial
	extent of the human brain, the second derived from white-matter tractography
	applied to diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) for a human subject.
	We use the combination of graph theoretical measures of the connection
	matrices and numerical simulations to explicate the importance of
	both connectivity strength and delays in shaping dynamic behaviour.
	Our results demonstrate that the brain dynamics derived from the
	CoCoMac database are more complex and biologically more realistic
	than the one based on the DSI database. We propose that the reason
	for this difference is the absence of directed weights in the DSI
	connectivity matrix.},

	This simulation environment enables the model-based inference of
	neurophysiological mechanisms across different brain scales that
	underlie the generation of macroscopic neuroimaging signals including
	functional MRI (fMRI), EEG and MEG. Researchers from different backgrounds
	can benefit from an integrative software platform including a supporting
	framework for data management (generation, organization, storage,
	integration and sharing) and a simulation core written in Python.
	TVB allows the reproduction and evaluation of personalized configurations
	of the brain by using individual subject data. This personalization
	facilitates an exploration of the consequences of pathological changes
	in the system, permitting to investigate potential ways to counteract
	such unfavorable processes. The architecture of TVB supports interaction
	with MATLAB packages, for example, the well known Brain Connectivity
	Toolbox. TVB can be used in a client-server configuration, such that
	it can be remotely accessed through the Internet thanks to its web-based
	HTML5, JS, and WebGL graphical user interface. TVB is also accessible
	as a standalone cross-platform Python library and application, and
	users can interact with the scientific core through the scripting
	interface IDLE, enabling easy modeling, development and debugging
	of the scientific kernel. This second interface makes TVB extensible
	by combining it with other libraries and modules developed by the
	Python scientific community. In this article, we describe the theoretical
	background and foundations that led to the development of TVB, the
	architecture and features of its major software components as well
	as potential neuroscience applications.},

  abstract = {Full brain network models comprise a large-scale connectivity (the
	connectome) and neural mass models as the network's nodes. Neural
	mass models absorb implicitly a variety of properties in their constant
	parameters to achieve a reduction in complexity. In situations, where
	the local network connectivity undergoes major changes, such as in
	development or epilepsy, it becomes crucial to model local connectivity
	explicitly. This leads naturally to a description of neural fields
	on folded cortical sheets with local and global connectivities. The
	numerical approximation of neural fields in biologically realistic
	situations as addressed in Virtual Brain simulations (see http://thevirtualbrain.org/app/
	(version 1.0)) is challenging and requires a thorough evaluation
	if the Virtual Brain approach is to be adapted for systematic studies
	of disease and disorders. Here we analyze the sampling problem of
	neural fields for arbitrary dimensions and provide explicit results
	for one, two and three dimensions relevant to realistically folded
	cortical surfaces. We characterize (i) the error due to sampling
	of spatial distribution functions; (ii) useful sampling parameter
	ranges in the context of encephalographic (EEG, MEG, ECoG and functional
	MRI) signals; (iii) guidelines for choosing the right spatial distribution
	function for given anatomical and geometrical constraints.},
