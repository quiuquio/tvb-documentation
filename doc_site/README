This is the documentation source for building TVB documentation web-site.

In order to have a new documentation site generated, just run

make -f MakeFile html

in the folder where MakeFile is placed.

TODO about documentation:
- styles/TVB_logo.svg is duplicate
- several link_*.rst files were necessary to be able to group the RST under a separate folder then the manuals
- doc_site/advances/images and schemas as shortcuts
- doc_site/basic/screenshots and icons shortcuts

- improve 'index'
- place favicon to the documentaiton website
- authors list on the main documentaiton-site (now only in the API)
