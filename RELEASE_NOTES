 The Virtual Brain (TVB)
 Version: 1.0.3 - build 4730
 Release Date: 30 Mar 2013
 Description: Change TVB License. Branch a Simulation.
======================================================================================================================================

Important changes:
	- TVB license is now GPL v2
	- Saving a Simulation State is possible now.
	  "Branching" a previous executed simulation, will let you avoid having transient signal.
	- TVB Scientific Library package is published on GitHub
	- BCT is available from the Large Scale Connectivity page as well
	- A new Connectivity importer has been added (accepting DTI Pipeline results)
	- Simulator Input Parameters "Variables Watched by Monitor" is not displayed as a multi-select component, instead of an array.

 The Virtual Brain (TVB)
 Version: 1.0.2 - build 4480
 Release Date: 08 Feb 2013
 Description: Stable console interface. Bug fixing. Small performance and usability improvements
======================================================================================================================================

The main addition of this release is a stable console interface. Aside from this there have been a number of improvements and fixes:
	- the fact that a Matlab installation makes BCT algorithms available in TVB is made more obvious in settings page
	- possibility to change between state-variable/modes in brain and time-series visualizers
	- two new models available: Deco-Jirsa(Mean-Field Brunel Wang) and Kuramoto Oscillator
	- operations are now transactional so invalid db states should not be generated
	- new DataTypes available: PsiTable, NerfTable, FaceSurface and CapEEG


======================================================================================================================================
 The Virtual Brain (TVB)
 Version: 1.0.1 - build 4280
 Release Date: 18 Dec 2012
 Description: Performance improvement. Bug fixing
======================================================================================================================================

This is a minor release but with important achievements on performance and code-cleanness:
- improve performance for running a simulation on regions level with Raw monitor with a factor of 10;
- improve performance on loading web pages, by making sure no duplicate JS/CSS files are loaded and some asynchronous work is done, where possible;
- fix HDF5 concurrency problems by replacing the library used behind (from pyTables to H5PY);
- fix MPLH5 portlets concurrency problem (when multiple of them are selected on the same page);
- include IDLE python module, for preparing console-users.

When running TVB 1.0.1 after you previously had TVB version 1.0 installed be advised that on the first login, all your datatypes
will be upgraded from TVB 1.0 pyTables format to H5PY. This might take a while depending on the amount of data you have generated.
Please be patient and don't shut down TVB during this process. You also have the option to execute the tvb_clean command and drop
previous data in which case the above step is skipped.

 The Virtual Brain (TVB)
 Version: 1.0 - build 3970
 Release Date: 13 Oct 2012
 Description: SFN 2012 release
======================================================================================================================================

This is a full-features release for TVB software.
 - You can install TVB on Mac OS (x32 or x64 architecture), Linux (x32 or x64) or Windows (x32)
 - TVB can be installed in 3 different configurations:
    * on a personal computer for single-user usage;
    * on a server and made accessible to an unlimited number of users through browser.
      The server is expected to have a decent hardware, based on the expected number of clients. 
      Each client will need to have a compatible graphic card, and WebGL compatible browser.
    * or on a cluster (similar with server installation, but with parallelization support).
      When installed on a cluster, OAR is expected to be configured separately of TVB.
 - Default user is the same: admin/pass , but you can change it when TVB settings page is first displayed.
 - At startup, a default project will be created, containing demo-data as well (Connectivity, Cortical Surface, Projection Matrices, Sensors)
 - Default data is automatically filled, with every new project you create.
 - When filling parameters for the simulations, you can consult the manual about their meaning and the tooltips for each parameter.
 
 Known issues:
 - on Linux systems, Chrome browser has a bug when displaying select tags inside an overlay. 
   We have one situations for this, when displaying a visualizer's top-right call-out. 
   As this is a known bug in Chrome, we will wait for the next release to fix it. Until then we advise you to use FireFox while under Linux.

 The Virtual Brain (TVB)
 Version: 0.9T1 - build 1883
 Release Date: 6 March 2012
 Description: First TVB Teaser Release.
======================================================================================================================================

This is a Teaser package.
 - Default user is admin/pass
 - At startup a default project is created and a default set of input-data will exist in that project.
 - Simulations can be launched, with any of the models/monitors in the system.
 - If you have Octave or Matlab in the path, Brain Connectivity analyzers will be visible and ready for execution.
 - Once you have some data in your project, you should go to the visualizers area and see them in multiple formats, 
 	or use context-menu (right-click menu) on a specific DataType (pages Project-Operations or Project-Data Structure) to see available visualizers/analyzers.
 

Some of the capabilities that are currently in work are disabled from this version:
 - import / upload /export buttons are visible but disabled
 - input fields for the simulation are fixed, except for monitor, model and surface/region.
