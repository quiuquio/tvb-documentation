Document Guidelines
===================
The purpose of these document guidelines is to create a coherent set of documents
that clarify the functionality of |TVB|.
These documents are meant to be readily available not only to the development
team members, but also to management and other interested parties.

Here we try to provide specific guidelines for each of the documents,
to suggest responsibility for their creation and maintenance, and to describe
how the documents are/should be interrelated.

General Guidelines
==================


Accessibility
-------------
Documents developed for the |TVB| will be organized and made available for
downloading via the SVN repository: https://repo.thevirtualbrain.org/svn/tvb/trunk/docs/manuals.
Each of the manuals/docs presented below has it's own folder in this structure,
so all artifacts strict related to that doc (images, styles, ...) should be placed into
that folder.


File format
-----------
Documents should be available in a simple text format. We recommend that they be
written in rst (reStructuredText) and based on a set of templates
RST was chosen because:

- it is simple;
- it can produce both print and web documentation;
- it is the format generated by the python compatible auto-documentation tool SPHINX.

For more details about the rst style format, read the rst quick reference at:
** http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html **

Templates & Styles
------------------

There are some common elements for all documents, so we put them into special folders:
1. tvb/trunk/docs/manuals/styles
   Contains styles to be applied when generate PDF and HTML files as follow:
           a) pdf_doc.style - used when generating PDF files. So, any change related to colors/fonts/position
               of PDF elements should go here.
           b) html_doc.css - this is the place where we customize the look&feel for generated HTML content,
                which at this moment represents online-help.

2.tvb/trunk/docs/manuals/templates
   Contains templates to be used while generating PDF/HTML files.
   					a) template.rst - has content that generates first page (logo, title, ...), table of contents
   					   and header/footer format
   					b) constants.rst - defines some values that are user through all manuals (e.g TVB name, url ...)
   						 

!!! IMPORTANT: 
	- please be careful when changing these templates and styles. They apply to **ALL** TVB documents.
	- constants.rst file is included DYNAMICALLY at build time into all rst files that generates online-help,
	  so this file MUST NOT be deleted.
       

Documents Structure
------------------

In order to have a consistent structure and format for all documents it's important to follow
some rules while writing docs:
1. Each manual/document must have a MAIN document where other RST files can be included.

2. Each MAIN document must start with a section where to define constants for doc title, description, version and revision. 
    .. |TITLE| replace:: Installation Manual
    .. |DESCRIPTION| replace:: Installation Manual for |TVB|
    .. |VERSION| replace:: 1.0
    .. |REVISION| replace:: 0.1

3. Each MAIN document then has to include a template file. This will provide automatically first page
   (with TVB logo, title, version, ...), table of contents and specify content for page header/footer.
    .. include:: ../templates/pdf_template.rst

4. Because we have some documents that include other RST files, it's important to have the same "scheme"
   for chapter identification. In this respect here is the order of the characters to be used
   while defining chapters/sub-chapters/paragraphs ...
   a) ========================
   b) ------------------------
   c) ........................
   d) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   e) ************************
   f) ++++++++++++++++++++++++
   
5. After any change in TVB documents, please generate at least PDF version to ensure there is no 
   error in the document. Next chapter explains how to do that.

Screenshots
-----------

Most of TVB documents include images and screenshots of the web interface. This is ok, 
but we have to consider a few aspects when introducing images in our documentation:
- image size/resolution: please be aware of the size of the images you are using into documentaion. 
    In order to introduce them into documentation, any framework/software has to adjust them, which 
    measn processing time and quality reduction. 
- image format: current recommended format for storing/using images is png but if there are 
		cases when you don't need a high level of details jpg format can be used too.

IMPORTANT: 
In case of UserGuide, from wich we automatically generate Online-Help please use JPG format
for screenshots. Also, if you have any tools please try to pre-process these images to reduce their 
size as much as possible, without loosing details. 
This is important because it reduces the time to show online help into client browser.

Create PDF & HTML
-----------------

At build time for all TVB manuals we generate appropriate PDF files and from some parts of 
User's Guide (related to UI) generate online-help. As a result TVB release (zip files)
contains into /docs folder all PDF files. HTML content is placed in a folder that
makes it available through web interface.

Most probably you don't want to create a full TVB distribution, only to check if your
document is ok, so that's why we created some scripts that creates only PDF/HTML content.

To run these scripts, you need to have the following packages installed:
- Python >= version 2.6
- additional Python libraries (rst2pdf, rst2html, docutils, svglib)

1. Scripts to generate PDFs
	- they are placed in trunk/docs/manuals: generate_pdf.bat (Windows) / generate_pdf.sh (Linux)
		These scripts generate a PDF file for each manual/doc and place them in the same folder where 
		scripts are placed.

2. Script to generate both PDFs and HTMLs
	- this script is trunk\doc_gen\doc_generator.py 
	  Running this Python script will generate PDF files in trunk/dist/docs folder and HTML in
	  trunk\tvb\interfaces\web\static\help
	  
	 In case you want to generate only parts of the documentation please run this script with one of the
	 available options (see them with: python doc_generator.py -h)
	 a) -o option: generates only online help [this is usefull in case you want to see online help without running a distribution]
	 b) -p option: generates only PDF manuals in "dist" folder
	 c) -a option: generates only API DOC structure in "dist" folder"

Simulator Documentation
-----------------------

The entire Simulator documentation can be found in trunk\tvb\simulator\doc. Mainly here you can see
the RST files with texts and all necessary images are placed into ./img folder. 

!!! Important: but at this moment images are not generated automatically at build time. So for any
chage in the documentation or code we have to generate them and commit on SVN using:
a) to generate class diagrams please run: class_diagrams.sh
b) to generate model images please run  : python generate_model_phase_plane_images.py

and do not forget to commit on svn images used into RST files. 

To check, for missing images you can try to generate PDF for tvb.simulator.rst (with rst2pdf) 
and look for missing image errors.

Using a consistent format will make it easier to compile the documents and
maintain them as a coherent body of documentation.
